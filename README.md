This repository contains a demo proof of concept implementation for shadowing memory regions in Windows. It was created as part of a blog post discussing the topic and also serves as a basis for the HyperDeceit project, which is currently in development.

Please do not use this code for production, as it is no where near ready for it. However bug reports and feedback are welcome.
